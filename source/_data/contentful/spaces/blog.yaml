  postSummary: New data sources from the private sector have enormous potential to
    complement and enhance official statistics by, for example, providing more timely
    data and developing new areas for analysis.

The increasing number of research projects using this data underlines its potential. However, progress to operationalize the use of such data sources in the world of official statistics is proving to be slow due, in part, to barriers in gaining access to data from private corporations. Such barriers take the form of concerns on the part of private companies about losing their competitive advantage; legal constraints concerning privacy and confidentiality of client information; and the costs of setting up the necessary infrastructure and training staff for a non-core business related activity.

    Nonetheless, several business models that enable data exchange between private corporations and official statistics are emerging, including:
    - in-house production of statistics
    - transfer of data sets to end users
    - remote access to data
    - trusted 3rd parties (T3Ps)
    - moving algorithms rather than data.

    Each of these business models, along with their associated risks and technical and governance requirements, are examined in this paper.

    Incentives for private companies to share their data include the mutual benefits accrued from working with National Statistical Offices (NSOs), the potential to develop new analytical skills, improve their reputations, generate revenue, meet regulatory compliance and demonstrate corporate responsibility. There is growing recognition among many companies – albeit slowly – of these many incentives for making data available for public good.

    After examining various data sharing models and incentives, the paper makes a number of recommendations for policy actions. These recommendations suggest the need for NSOs to enter into partnerships with private providers:
    - Corporations should consider electing “data stewards” to act as focal points for data access.
    - A network to share experiences and know-how around data sharing and evidence of impact should be created.
    - A repository of case-studies that highlight innovation in sharing practices should be developed.
    - A decision tree to help assess benefits and risks of sharing corporate data should be defined.
    - A standardized safe environment for sharing data without risk of compromising customer privacy should be developed.

    Michael Thomas at [FastCompany](https://www.fastcompany.com/40402583/these-syrian-refugees-created-their-own-aid-agency): “…“In the refugee camps, we have two things: people and time,” Jackl explained. He and his friends decided that they would organize people to improve the camp. The idea was to solve two problems at once: Give refugees purpose, and make life in the camp better for everyone….

    It began with repurposing shipping material. The men noticed that every day, dozens of shipments of food, medicine, and other aid came to their camp. But once the supplies were unloaded, aid workers would throw the pallets away. Meanwhile, people were sleeping in tents that would flood when it rained. So Jackl led an effort to break the pallets down and use the wood to create platforms on which the tents could sit.

    Shortly afterwards, they used scrap wood and torn pieces of fabric to build a school, and eventually found a refugee who was a teacher to lead classes. The philosophy was simple and powerful: Use resources that would otherwise go to waste to improve life in their camp. As word spread of their work on social media, Jackl began to receive offers from people who wanted to donate money to his then unofficial cause. “All these people began asking me ‘What can I do? Can I give you money?’ And I’d tell them, ‘Give me materials,’” he said.

    “People think that refugees are weak. But they survived war, smugglers, and the camps,” Jackl explains. His mission is to change the refugee image from one of weakness to one of resilience and strength. Core to that is the idea that refugees can help one another instead of relying on aid workers and NGOs, a philosophy that he adopted from an NGO called Jafra that he worked for in Syria…([More](https://www.fastcompany.com/40402583/these-syrian-refugees-created-their-own-aid-agency))”
